# Replay Protocol - Detecting React Mount/Render Behavior

This example demonstrates how to use the Replay protocol to run analysis requests on a recording, then use the returned analysis data to investigate the call stacks and variable contents at different pause points to answer questions about an app's behavior (such as whether a React component execution is due to the component being mounted, or re-rendered).

A video walkthrough of this example is available here:
